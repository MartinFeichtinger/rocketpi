# Rocketpi
The aim of this project is to controll a water rocket with a Raspberry Pi Zero.

## What is a water rocket?
A water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass.
The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. Like all rocket engines, it operates on the principle of Newton's third law of motion.

## What's special about our water rocket?
The fuel tank consists of a plastic bottle. This bottle can withstand a maximum pressure of 9 bar.
In order to achieve a higher flight altitude, we have decided to strengthen this plastic bottle with fiber-reinforced tape.
Whith this new tank we are able to reach pressures up to 13 bar.
Futhermore a Raspberry Pi Zero is used to eject the parachute and determine the flight altitude.
The parachute is attached to the top of the water rocket. To eject the parachute, the pre-tensioned handle is opened with three servo motors.
