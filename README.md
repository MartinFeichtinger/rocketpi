# Rocketpi
The aim of this project is to controll a water rocket with a Raspberry Pi Zero.

## What is a water rocket?
A water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass.
The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. Like all rocket engines, it operates on the principle of Newton's third law of motion.

## What's special about our water rocket?
The fuel tank consists of a plastic bottle. This bottle can withstand a maximum pressure of 9 bar.
In order to achieve a higher flight altitude, we have decided to strengthen this plastic bottle with fiber-reinforced tape.
Whith this new tank we are able to reach pressures up to 13 bar.
Futhermore a Raspberry Pi Zero is used to eject the parachute and determine the flight altitude.
The parachute is attached to the top of the water rocket. To eject the parachute, the pre-tensioned handle is opened with three servo motors.

### Raspberry Pi Zero
The Raspberry Pi Zero is a tiny, affordable computer board developed by the Raspberry Pi Foundation. It's small but powerful, with features like a CPU, RAM, storage, and ports for connecting to displays and other devices. It's used for various projects like IoT, robotics, and gaming consoles due to its low cost and versatility.

### BerryIMUv4
IMU stands for Inertial Measurement Unit. It's a device that measures and reports specific forces like acceleration and angular velocity, using a combination of accelerometers, gyroscopes, and sometimes magnetometers. IMUs are commonly used in applications like navigation systems, robotics, virtual reality, and motion tracking. They provide essential data for determining an object's orientation, position, and movement in 3D space.

The BerryIMUv4 is an IMU that was specially developed for the rasberry pi zero. In addition to acceleration, rotation rate and magnetic field, it is possible to measure barometric altitude and temperature. Furthermore, there is a GPS module for position determination.
