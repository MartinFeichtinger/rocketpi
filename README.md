# Rocketpi
The aim of this project is to controll a water rocket with a Raspberry Pi Zero.

## What is a water rocket?
A water rocket is a type of model rocket using water as its reaction mass.
The water is forced out by a pressurized gas, typically compressed air. Like all rocket engines, it operates on the principle of Newton's third law of motion.

## Whats special about our water rocket?

The parachute is attached to the top of the water rocket. To eject the parachute, the pre-tensioned handle is opened with three servo motors.
