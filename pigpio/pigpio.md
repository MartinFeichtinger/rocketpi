# pigpio
For all further C programms we will use the `pigpiod_if2.h` library to controll the GPIO-Pins of the Raspberry Pi.
This library allow to control the GPIOs via the socket interface to the pigpio daemon.

To be able to use this library and program the GPIO-Pins, the pigpio package must be installed as explained in the setup guild.
